In order to quicken the building of repetitive features, this mod will allow you to record block placement patterns, then build them instantly later.

Builds require a name, and can be cycled through with a selectable key; cycling while sneaking cycles backwards.

BE CAREFUL ABOUT MODIFYING BUILD NAMES IN THE MENU! If the old name for a build is missing, it will be deleted! You can reorder them, but _be careful!_

ALSO! BE CAREFUL ABOUT USING THIS ON SERVERS! It should work, but if they have _ANY_ anticheat, it might get you banned!
